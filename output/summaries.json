    "long_summary": "Political bettors on Polymarket and other platforms are paying attention to Canada as the nation heads to the polls. Unlike the U.S. election, there isn't a crypto angle up north with leaders' campaigns focused on the trade war and inflation. Critics say Poilievre's chances are being suppressed and do not reflect the political sentiment of the populace. There's no credible evidence that this is happening even as Polymarket is banned in Canada's largest province after a settlement with its securities regulator."

    "long_summary": "Bitcoin (BTC) returned to positive territory for the year for the first time in almost two months. Its current performance, up less 1.5% since Dec. 31, places it between gold, which has gained 24% and the Nasdaq 100, which is down over 7%. Analyzing bitcoin\u2019s correlation coefficients over a 30-day moving average, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now shows a strong correlation of 0.70 with gold. This suggests bitcoin is aligning more closely with gold's behavior than with tech equities."
