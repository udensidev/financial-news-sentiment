    "title": "Trump Token's 85% Weekly Surge Defies Democrats' Call for Impeachment, Massive Unlocks",
    "text": "TRUMP, the memecoin tied to U.S. President Donald Trump, is up about 16% in the last 24 hours, even as Democratic lawmakers cite the president\u2019s involvement with the token as potential grounds for impeachment and after a massive unlock earlier in the month. At a town hall on Friday, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) pointed to the crypto project offering its top holders an invitation to a dinner event with President Trump, calling it a clear case of selling access to the presidency, NBC News reports. \u201cWhen the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him. There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,\u201d Ossify said. U.S. Senators Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) also sent a letter on April 25 to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics asking for an investigation to determine if President Trump violated federal ethics rules by inviting top investors.

All You Need Is $420 Worth of TRUMP The allegations stem from an announcement that a private dinner will be held on May 22, where the top 220 TRUMP memecoin holders can meet with the U.S. President. Still, the TRUMP token has kept on rising. The memecoin surged over 70% after the event was announced and has already been up 85% over the last seven days. The rise came even after the token saw a massive $320 million unlock earlier this month, significantly inflating its circulating supply. In less than three months, TRUMP token is set to endure an additional unlock of 25.1% of its current circulating supply, at the time of writing, worth nearly $780 million. Despite the recent rise, the token is still down more than 77% from its all-time high above $70, which it saw shortly after launch. Its subsequent price plunge led to an estimated $2 billion of investor losses.

    "title": "Bitcoin Poised for Strongest Weekly Gain Since Trump Win as ETFs Gobble $2.7B Inflows",
    "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) continued its spring rally on Friday and is on track for its strongest weekly showing since Trump's election victory. The largest and oldest cryptocurrency held around $95,000 during U.S. afternoon hours, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH) followed closely, gaining 2% to hover just over $1,800. Sui\u2019s native (SUI), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Hedera\u2019s HBAR led gains in the broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index. Today's gains cap an exceptional momentum for crypto markets recovering from the early April lows amid tariff turmoil. BTC is up over 11% since Monday, putting it at its largest weekly gain since November 2024, when Donald Trump clinched the U.S. presidency, kickstarting a broad-market crypto rally.

(Friday inflow data will be published later.) Bitcoin's recent strength relative to U.S. stocks and gold underscores BTC's decoupling from traditional macro assets, said David Duong, Coinbase Institutional's global head of research. \"It\u2019s rare to witness market inflection points in real time, as we only tend to recognize major regime shifts with the benefit of time and reflection,\" Duong said in a Friday report. \"This week\u2019s decoupling of bitcoin\u2019s performance from that of traditional macro assets may be as close as we come to such a moment.\" \"In our view, this divergence highlights bitcoin\u2019s maturing role as a store-of-value asset\u2014one that is increasingly being viewed by institutional and retail investors alike as resilient against the macroeconomic forces affecting risk assets more broadly,\" he wrote. Doung noted that the thesis is gaining traction with more companies adopting BTC corporate treasuries. Following the success of Michael Saylor's Strategy, Twenty One Capital, a new firm backed by Tether, Bitfinex, SoftBank, and a Cantor Fitzgerald affiliate, also plans to hold 42,000 BTC at launch. Due in part to recent accumulation, liquidity in the spot BTC market has been \"significantly drained,\" Dr. Kirill Kretov, lead strategist at trading automation platform CoinPanel, said in a Telegram note. According to the firm's proprietary blockchain analysis, a large portion of bitcoin liquidity has been withdrawn from actively transacting addresses, including exchanges, since November 2024, exposing markets to volatile price swings. \u201cThe market is thin, vulnerable, and easily moved by large players,\" Kretov said. \"Sharp swings of 10% up or down are likely to remain the norm for now.\" While the route could be choppy, this week\u2019s rally is likely the early innings of bitcoin's next leg higher to new records, said John Glover, chief investment officer of crypto lender Ledn. Based on his technical analysis using Elliott Waves, he said BTC began the fifth and final wave of its multi-year bull market. Elliott Wave theory suggests asset prices move in predictable patterns called waves, driven by collective investor psychology. These patterns typically unfold in five-wave trends, in which the first, third, and fifth waves are impulsive rallies, while the second and fourth waves are corrective phases. While retesting this month's low at $75,000 cannot be ruled out, Glover sees BTC climbing to a cycle top around late 2025, early 2026. \"My expectations continue to be for a rally to $133-$136k into the end of this year, beginning of next,\u201d he said.

    "title": "DOGE Mining Firm Z Squared To Go Public Through Merger",
    "text": "Z Squared, a firm that specializes in mining dogecoin (DOGE), the dog-themed memecoin that was propelled to mainstream recognition by Elon Musk in 2021, is merging with biopharmaceutical company Coeptis (COEP). The merger will enable the resulting company to keep DOGE mining operations going, while Coeptis\u2019 pharmaceutical business will be spun out and operated separately. As a result, the firm will become one of the largest publicly-traded companies with a primary focus mining dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies like litecoin (LTC). \u201cGoing public provides us with broader access to capital markets to fuel the growth of our mining operations and pursue additional strategic opportunities we believe will be accretive to shareholders,\u201d Z Squared CEO David Halabu told CoinDesk in an email. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025. The combined entity will have 9,000 U.S.-based DOGE mining machines. The company declined to share revenue figures with CoinDesk. COEP is down 37.5% on the day. Spun out from Bitcoin (BTC) in 2013, Dogecoin follows a similar Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, meaning that miners compete to solve an algorithmic problem in order to produce the next block on the blockchain; whoever solves it first is awarded coins for their efforts. At $27 billion in market capitalization, DOGE is currently the eighth largest cryptocurrency, just ahead of Cardano\u2019s ADA and Tron\u2019s TRX. With the bitcoin mining industry becoming extremely competitive in the last few years, mining operations are seeking new avenues for revenue \u2014 by dedicating resources for AI purposes, for example, or mining other cryptocurrencies like dogecoin and litecoin. Bitcoin mining firm BIT Mining (BTCM), for example, announced in December that it had made three times more money mining DOGE and LTC than BTC since it expanded into those cryptocurrencies. Z Squared isn't the first crypto miner to go public using this strategy. Other entities such as Core Scientific (CORZ) and TeraWulf (TERA) employed a similar playbook in 2022. UPDATE (April 25, 18:40 UTC): The article was updated with extra context about bitcoin miners going public through mergers. UPDATE (April 25, 19:40 UTC): The article was updated with information about COEP stock performance. Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

    "title": "Stablecoins Could Bring 'ChatGPT' Moment to Blockchain Adoption, Hit $3.7T by 2030: Citi",
    "text": "Global bank Citi has predicted 2025 could be a possible inflection point for blockchain adoption driven by stablecoins, akin to the breakout year artificial intelligence (AI) had with popular application ChatGPT. \"2025 has the potential to be blockchain\u2019s \u2018ChatGPT\u2019 moment,\" the bank's analysts said in a report published earlier this week. At the center of the Citi's projection are stablecoins, a class of cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. These tokens, led by Tether's $145 billion USDT and Circle's $60 billion USDC, have seen tremendous growth recently and are increasingly being used for payments and remittances globally. Citi sees the asset class potentially growing to $1.6 trillion by 2030 in its base case from the current $230 billion, with the caveat that regulatory support and institutional integration take hold. In the bank's more optimistic scenario, the market could balloon to $3.7 trillion, though lingering structural challenges could keep the number closer to $500 billion in the bank's bear case. A major catalyst is the supportive regulatory stance in the U.S., with a recent presidential executive order directing the formation of a federal framework for digital assets, the report said. The clarity around stablecoin rules could allow these tokens to be more deeply embedded in the financial system, offering faster payments, improved transparency and more efficient asset settlement.  \"This could lead to greater adoption of blockchain-based money and spur other use cases, financial and beyond, in the U.S. private and public sector,\" the authors noted. Stablecoins are expected to remain heavily dollar-denominated in the future. The report anticipates that around 90% of stablecoins in circulation in 2030 will still be tied to the U.S. dollar, cementing its dominance. This has major implications for the global financial system. Dollar stablecoin issuers could become one of the largest buyers of U.S. Treasuries, assuming that regulations push toward backing tokens with low-risk, highly liquid traditional financial assets like government bonds. Citibank estimated issuers could hold $1.2 trillion in U.S. government debt by the end of the decade, potentially surpassing all major foreign sovereign holders.   Meanwhile, the central banks of countries in Europe and Asia will likely promote their own digital currencies, or CBDCs, the report noted. The report pointed to several risks that could hamper the growth. Stablecoins de-pegged nearly 1,900 times in 2023 alone, including more than 600 instances involving major tokens, the report's authors wrote, citing Moody's data.  In extreme cases, mass redemptions\u2014like those following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that consequently hit USDC\u2014can disrupt crypto liquidity, force automated selloffs and ripple through financial markets, the authors added.

Some users on X claimed that only holders with more than $300,000 in tokens could participate. Others speculated that the wallet ranked 220 on a blockchain explorer was the minimum cutoff.

Currently, the leaderboard's top wallet, under the pseudonym \u201cSun,\u201d holds over 1.1 million TRUMP tokens, worth nearly $14 million. The 220th spot was held by \u201cHAR,\u201d with just 35.3 TRUMP tokens, or about $420 in dollar terms. Twenty five wallets are listed as VIPs on the leaderboard, where the cut-off holder sits on over $400,000 worth of TRUMP. The team also addressed concerns about token unlocks affecting the leaderboard, stating that both the cliff unlock and subsequent daily unlocks would remain inaccessible for 90 days, outlasting the competition itself. \u201cWe want to say again that the tokens from the initial cliff unlock and the following 3 months of daily unlocks will remain locked, each for an additional 90 days,\u201d it said.
