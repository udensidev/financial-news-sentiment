    "title": "Prediction Markets Traders Bet Big on Easy Liberal Win as Canadians Head to the Polls",
    "text": "Political bettors on Polymarket and other platforms are paying attention to Canada as the nation heads to the polls. As the country's 45th election comes to a close, a contract asking bettors to predict who will be Canada's next Prime Minister gives the Liberal Party's Mark Carney a 78% chance, and the Conservatives' Pierre Poilievre a 22% shot. Political bettors are slightly more skeptical of Carney's chances of winning than the polls, but both are pointing in the same direction. A poll aggregator from public broadcaster CBC puts Carney's chances at 89%. Myriad Markets, another prediction market, is giving Carney similar odds to Polymarket. FanDuel, a licensed betting platform open only to residents of Ontario, Canada, initially gave the Conservatives a sharp, contrarian lead of 70%, according to a report from the National Post. Still, odds have fallen in line with prediction markets, and it now gives the Liberals a roughly 80% chance of winning. Unlike the U.S. election, there isn't a crypto angle up north with leaders' campaigns focused on the trade war and inflation. A growing narrative in certain corners of the internet is that Polymarket is prone to manipulation and its numbers aren't reliable, criticisms that echo what was said in the last weeks of the U.S. election when the site gave Donald Trump a commanding lead as polls showed a tight race. Critics say Poilievre's chances are being suppressed and do not reflect the political sentiment of the populace. However, manipulating prediction markets would be expensive, and there's no credible evidence that this is happening even as Polymarket is banned in Canada's largest province after a settlement with its securities regulator. Data portal Polymarket Analytics shows that the Canadian election contract leads the platform in open interest, which is the total value of active, unsettled bets and a good measure of market engagement. Market data also shows that position holding is quite distributed, with the largest holder of the Poilivere\u2014No side of the contracting holding 6% of all shares and the largest holder of the Carney\u2014Yes side holding 5%. One bettor, who is betting big on Carney with a six-figure position, who spoke to CoinDesk, said their motives are non-partisan, and said that the quality of Canadian polling makes him confident that the Liberals will win. \"Poilievre needs a 7-point polling error to win and I think the probability of that is closer to 7% than his current market price of 23c,\" trader Tenadome told CoinDesk via an X DM. \"The pool of Poilievre bettors seems to largely be very dumb money that believes in things like China is rigging the polls.\" Currently, the trader with the largest winnings on the contract is \"ball-sack\" with a profit of $124,890, thanks to bets on Carney. On the other side of the trade is \"biden4prez,\" who lost just over $98,000 \u2013 the most out of any trader \u2013 betting on Poilievre and against Carney.

    "title": "Bitcoin to Hit New All-Time High Around $120K in Q2, Standard Chartered Says",
    "text": " Strategic allocation away from U.S. assets by investors could see bitcoin hit a new all-time high in the second quarter of the year, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a report Monday. Kendrick sees the world's largest cryptocurrency as reaching $120,000 this quarter as he reiterated his previous target of $200,000 by the end of 2025.  Bitcoin was trading around $95,300 at publication time. Kendrick noted that the U.S. Treasury term premium, which is closely correlated to the bitcoin price, is at a 12-year high. Accumulation by whales has also been strong. In addition, bitcoin time-of-day analysis suggests that American investors may be looking for non-U.S. assets, he said. Lastly, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows in the last week suggest \"safe-haven reallocation from gold into BTC,\" wrote Kendrick. \"Bitcoin may be a better hedge than gold against financial system risks,\" he added.

    "title": "Bitcoin Turns Positive Year-to-Date as It Veers Toward Digital Gold Narrative",
    "text": "Bitcoin (BTC) returned to positive territory for the year for the first time in almost two months, approaching $95,000 and erasing a drop of as much as 18%. Its current performance, up less 1.5% since Dec. 31, places it between gold, which has gained 24% and the Nasdaq 100, which is down over 7%. As a result, the narrative positioning bitcoin as either a leveraged tech stock or digital gold is leaning slightly toward the digital gold narrative. But only just. Analyzing bitcoin\u2019s correlation coefficients over a 30-day moving average, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now shows a strong correlation of 0.70 with gold and a weaker 0.53 correlation with the Nasdaq 100. This suggests bitcoin is aligning more closely with gold's behavior than with tech equities. Correlation values can run between 1, a strong positive correlation, and -1, a strong negative correlation. Last week, the bitcoin price rose 10%, its strongest performance since the week ended Nov. 17 during price run following President Donald Trump's election victory.  Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s tariffs continue to feed economic uncertainty. U.S. levies on Chinese goods were raised to 145% earlier this month, leading to a significant drop in cargo shipment demand, according to Bloomberg. As noted in the report, major retailers like Walmart are warning that empty shelves and higher prices could return, reminiscent of the COVID era.
